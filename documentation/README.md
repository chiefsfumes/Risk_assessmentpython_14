# Climate Risk Assessment Tool Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the Climate Risk Assessment Tool, a sophisticated Python-based solution for analyzing and evaluating climate-related risks across various scenarios. The tool incorporates advanced analytics, machine learning algorithms, and scenario analysis to offer a holistic view of potential climate risks across physical, transition, nature, and systemic risk cascades.

## High-Level Process Description

The Climate Risk Assessment Tool follows these sequential steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Load risk data and external data
   - Extract risk statements from 10-K filings using NLP

2. **Risk Categorization and Prioritization**
   - Categorize risks into main categories and subcategories
   - Prioritize risks based on impact and likelihood
   - Integrate SASB materiality assessment
   - Perform PESTEL analysis

3. **Risk Interaction Analysis**
   - Analyze interactions between risks
   - Build a risk network
   - Identify central risks and risk clusters
   - Analyze risk cascades and feedback loops

4. **Scenario Analysis**
   - Define multiple climate scenarios
   - Simulate scenario impacts on each risk
   - Perform Monte Carlo simulations for each scenario
   - Calculate Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
   - Conduct stress testing

5. **Advanced Risk Analysis**
   - Generate risk narratives using LLM
   - Identify key uncertainties across scenarios
   - Analyze systemic risks
   - Assess aggregate impact and identify tipping points

6. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Project risk impacts over time using ARIMA models
   - Analyze impact trends and identify critical periods
   - Forecast cumulative impact

7. **Resilience Assessment**
   - Evaluate system resilience across scenarios
   - Identify trigger points for cascading risks

8. **Reporting and Visualization**
   - Generate comprehensive risk assessment report
   - Create visualizations of risk matrices, networks, and projections
   - Produce stakeholder-specific reports

9. **Mitigation Strategy Development**
   - Generate mitigation strategies for high-impact risks
   - Provide recommendations based on scenario analysis and systemic risk assessment

This process ensures a thorough and multi-faceted analysis of climate-related risks, enabling organizations to make informed decisions and develop robust strategies for climate risk management.
