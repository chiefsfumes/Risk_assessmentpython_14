# Step 4: Scenario Analysis

In this step, we analyze how our risk ("Increased frequency of extreme weather events") behaves under different climate scenarios. This helps us understand the potential impacts of the risk under various future conditions.

## 4.1 Defining Scenarios

We use predefined scenarios from `src/config.py`. For our walkthrough, let's consider two scenarios:

1. "Net Zero 2050": A scenario where global warming is limited to 1.5Â°C
2. "Delayed Transition": A scenario with more severe climate change impacts

## 4.2 Simulating Scenario Impacts

The `simulate_scenario_impact` function in `src/risk_analysis/scenario_analysis.py` calculates the impact of our risk under each scenario:

```python
impacts = {
    "Net Zero 2050": 0.75,  # Lower impact due to mitigation efforts
    "Delayed Transition": 0.95  # Higher impact due to more severe climate change
}
```

## 4.3 Monte Carlo Simulations

The `monte_carlo_simulation` function performs multiple simulations to account for uncertainty:

```python
simulation_results = {
    "Net Zero 2050": SimulationResult(
        risk_id=1,
        scenario="Net Zero 2050",
        impact_distribution=[0.70, 0.75, 0.73, ...],
        likelihood_distribution=[0.75, 0.78, 0.72, ...]
    ),
    "Delayed Transition": SimulationResult(
        risk_id=1,
        scenario="Delayed Transition",
        impact_distribution=[0.90, 0.95, 0.93, ...],
        likelihood_distribution=[0.85, 0.88, 0.82, ...]
    )
}
```

## 4.4 Calculating VaR and CVaR

The `calculate_var_cvar` function estimates the Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for our risk:

```python
var_cvar_results = {
    "Net Zero 2050": {
        "VaR": 0.80,
        "CVaR": 0.85
    },
    "Delayed Transition": {
        "VaR": 0.95,
        "CVaR": 0.97
    }
}
```

## 4.5 Stress Testing

Finally, the `perform_stress_testing` function analyzes our risk under extreme scenarios:

```python
stress_test_results = {
    "Extreme Net Zero 2050": 0.85,
    "Extreme Delayed Transition": 0.99
}
```

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of how our risk of increased extreme weather events might manifest under different future scenarios, from the most optimistic to the most severe.
