# Step 5: Advanced Risk Analysis

In this step, we perform more sophisticated analyses on our risk ("Increased frequency of extreme weather events") to gain deeper insights.

## 5.1 Generating Risk Narratives

The `generate_risk_narratives` function in `src/risk_analysis/advanced_analysis.py` uses an LLM to create a narrative for our risk across different scenarios:

```python
risk_narrative = """
In the 'Net Zero 2050' scenario, the frequency of extreme weather events stabilizes by mid-century due to successful mitigation efforts. However, adaptation measures are still crucial to manage residual risks.

In the 'Delayed Transition' scenario, extreme weather events become significantly more frequent and severe, leading to widespread disruptions and substantial economic losses. This underscores the urgency of both mitigation and adaptation strategies.
"""
```

## 5.2 Identifying Key Uncertainties

The `identify_key_uncertainties` function analyzes the variability of our risk across scenarios:

```python
key_uncertainties = {
    1: {
        "impact_variance": 0.15,
        "likelihood_variance": 0.10
    }
}
```

This indicates that the impact of our risk varies more across scenarios than its likelihood.

## 5.3 Analyzing Systemic Risks

The `analyze_systemic_risks` function assesses whether our risk could have system-wide impacts:

```python
systemic_risks = {
    1: {
        "is_systemic": True,
        "systemic_factor": "Environmental",
        "connected_risks": [2, 5, 7]  # IDs of strongly connected risks
    }
}
```

## 5.4 Assessing Aggregate Impact

The `assess_aggregate_impact` function evaluates the potential compounding effects of our risk with others:

```python
aggregate_impact = {
    "mean": 0.85,
    "95th_percentile": 0.95
}
```

## 5.5 Identifying Tipping Points

Finally, the `identify_tipping_points` function looks for critical thresholds where our risk could lead to non-linear impacts:

```python
tipping_points = [
    {
        "risk_id": 1,
        "tipping_point_level": 0.8,
        "description": "At this level of extreme weather frequency, cascading failures in infrastructure become likely."
    }
]
```

These advanced analyses provide a nuanced understanding of our risk, its systemic importance, and potential tipping points.
