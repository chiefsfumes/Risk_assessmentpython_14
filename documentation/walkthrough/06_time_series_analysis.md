# Step 6: Time Series Analysis

In this step, we project how our risk ("Increased frequency of extreme weather events") might evolve over time.

## 6.1 Projecting Risk Impacts

The `project_risk_impact_arima` function in `src/risk_analysis/time_series_analysis.py` uses an ARIMA model to forecast the impact of our risk:

```python
time_series_results = {
    1: [0.9, 0.92, 0.94, 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, 0.98, 0.98, 0.99, 0.99]  # 10-year projection
}
```

This suggests an increasing trend in the impact of extreme weather events over the next decade.

## 6.2 Analyzing Impact Trends

The `analyze_impact_trends` function assesses the trend in our risk's impact:

```python
trend_analysis = {
    1: {
        "slope": 0.01,  # Positive slope indicates increasing trend
        "average_impact": 0.96,
        "max_impact": 0.99,
        "volatility": 0.03
    }
}
```

## 6.3 Identifying Critical Periods

The `identify_critical_periods` function pinpoints times when our risk's impact exceeds a certain threshold:

```python
critical_periods = {
    1: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  # Years where impact exceeds threshold
}
```

This suggests that the latter half of the decade could see consistently high impacts from extreme weather events.

## 6.4 Forecasting Cumulative Impact

Finally, the `forecast_cumulative_impact` function estimates the total impact of our risk over time:

```python
cumulative_impact = [0.9, 1.82, 2.76, 3.71, 4.67, 5.64, 6.62, 7.60, 8.59, 9.58]
```

This cumulative impact forecast highlights the potential for significant long-term effects from increased extreme weather events.

The time series analysis provides valuable insights into the potential future trajectory of our risk, helping to inform long-term planning and adaptation strategies.
