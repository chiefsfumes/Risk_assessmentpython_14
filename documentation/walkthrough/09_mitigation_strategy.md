# Step 9: Mitigation Strategy Development

In this final step, we develop strategies to mitigate our risk ("Increased frequency of extreme weather events") based on all the previous analyses.

## 9.1 Generating Mitigation Strategies

The `generate_mitigation_strategies` function in `src/mitigation.py` proposes strategies based on our risk analysis:

```python
mitigation_strategies = {
    1: [
        "Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure to withstand more frequent and severe weather events",
        "Develop and implement comprehensive emergency response and business continuity plans",
        "Diversify supply chains to reduce vulnerability to localized extreme weather impacts",
        "Engage in industry-wide collaboration for shared climate resilience solutions",
        "Invest in advanced weather forecasting and early warning systems"
    ]
}
```

## 9.2 Prioritizing Recommendations

The function also prioritizes these strategies based on their potential impact and feasibility:

```python
prioritized_recommendations = [
    {
        "strategy": "Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure",
        "impact": 0.8,
        "feasibility": 0.7,
        "timeframe": "Long-term",
        "cost": "High",
        "co_benefits": "Improved operational reliability, potential for reduced insurance premiums"
    },
    {
        "strategy": "Develop comprehensive emergency response plans",
        "impact": 0.7,
        "feasibility": 0.9,
        "timeframe": "Short-term",
        "cost": "Medium",
        "co_benefits": "Enhanced overall organizational resilience"
    },
    # ... other strategies ...
]
```

## 9.3 Scenario-Specific Strategies

The function also provides scenario-specific recommendations:

```python
scenario_strategies = {
    "Net Zero 2050": [
        "Focus on no-regret adaptation measures that provide benefits even in less severe scenarios",
        "Invest in green technologies that both mitigate climate change and enhance resilience"
    ],
    "Delayed Transition": [
        "Prepare for more severe impacts with robust adaptation measures",
        "Advocate for stronger climate policies to prevent this scenario"
    ]
}
```

## 9.4 Long-term Resilience Building

Finally, the function suggests long-term strategies for building overall resilience:

```python
long_term_strategies = [
    "Integrate climate risk considerations into all major business decisions",
    "Regularly update risk assessments and adaptation plans based on latest climate science",
    "Invest in research and development for innovative resilience solutions",
    "Engage with policymakers to support effective climate adaptation policies"
]
```

These mitigation strategies provide a roadmap for addressing the risk of increased extreme weather events, considering both short-term actions and long-term resilience building. They are tailored to different scenarios and prioritized based on their potential impact and feasibility, providing a comprehensive approach to climate risk management.
