# Step 8: Reporting and Visualization

In this final step, we compile all the analyses of our risk ("Increased frequency of extreme weather events") into comprehensive reports and visualizations.

## 8.1 Generating Risk Assessment Report

The `generate_report` function in `src/reporting.py` compiles all our analyses into a JSON report:

```python
report = {
    "risk_id": 1,
    "description": "Increased frequency of extreme weather events",
    "category": "Physical Risk",
    "current_likelihood": 0.8,
    "current_impact": 0.9,
    "scenario_analysis": {
        "Net Zero 2050": {"impact": 0.75, "likelihood": 0.7},
        "Delayed Transition": {"impact": 0.95, "likelihood": 0.9}
    },
    "time_series_projection": [0.9, 0.92, 0.94, 0.95, 0.96, 0.97, 0.98, 0.98, 0.99, 0.99],
    "systemic_risk_assessment": {
        "is_systemic": True,
        "centrality": 0.8,
        "connected_risks": [2, 5, 7]
    },
    "resilience_assessment": {
        "adaptive_capacity": 0.5,
        "potential_trigger_point": "Temperature increase: 2.0Â°C"
    }
}
```

## 8.2 Creating Visualizations

The `generate_visualizations` function in `src/visualization.py` creates various plots to visualize our risk:

1. Risk Matrix: Showing our risk's high likelihood and impact
2. Scenario Comparison: Comparing our risk's impact across different scenarios
3. Time Series Projection: Visualizing the projected increase in our risk's impact over time
4. Risk Network Graph: Highlighting our risk's central position and strong connections to other risks

## 8.3 Producing Stakeholder Reports

Finally, the `generate_stakeholder_reports` function in `src/reporting/stakeholder_reports.py` creates tailored reports for different stakeholders:

```python
stakeholder_reports = {
    "board_executive": {
        "summary": "Extreme weather events pose a significant and increasing risk...",
        "key_metrics": {"current_impact": 0.9, "projected_impact_2030": 0.99},
        "strategic_implications": "Urgent need for comprehensive adaptation strategies..."
    },
    "investors": {
        "financial_implications": "Potential for significant increase in weather-related losses...",
        "risk_adjusted_returns": "Considering extreme weather risks, risk-adjusted returns may decrease by..."
    },
    "regulators": {
        "compliance_status": "Current measures may be insufficient for projected risk levels...",
        "recommended_actions": "Enhance building codes, improve emergency response systems..."
    }
}
```

These reports and visualizations communicate the comprehensive analysis of our risk in formats tailored to different audiences, facilitating informed decision-making and effective risk management strategies.
