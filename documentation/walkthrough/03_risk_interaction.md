# Step 3: Risk Interaction Analysis

In this step, we analyze how our risk interacts with other risks in the system. This helps us understand the complex relationships between different risks and their potential compounding effects.

## 3.1 Analyzing Risk Interactions

The `analyze_risk_interactions` function in `src/risk_analysis/interaction_analysis.py` uses an LLM to assess how our risk ("Increased frequency of extreme weather events") might interact with other risks in the system.

For example, it might identify a strong interaction with a risk like "Supply chain disruptions":

```python
interaction = RiskInteraction(
    risk1_id=1,  # our risk
    risk2_id=5,  # "Supply chain disruptions" risk
    interaction_score=0.8,
    interaction_type="Strong",
    analysis="Increased frequency of extreme weather events can directly lead to more frequent and severe supply chain disruptions..."
)
```

## 3.2 Building the Risk Network

Next, the `build_risk_network` function creates a network graph where nodes are risks and edges represent interactions. Our risk would be a node in this network, with edges connecting it to other risks it interacts with.

## 3.3 Identifying Central Risks

The `identify_central_risks` function calculates various centrality measures for each risk in the network. Given that our risk interacts strongly with many other risks, it might be identified as a central risk:

```python
central_risks = {
    1: 0.75,  # our risk has a high centrality score
    2: 0.45,
    3: 0.60,
    ...
}
```

## 3.4 Detecting Risk Clusters

The `detect_risk_clusters` function uses K-means clustering to group similar risks. Our risk might be part of a cluster of physical risks:

```python
risk_clusters = {
    1: 0,  # our risk is in cluster 0
    2: 1,
    3: 0,
    ...
}
```

## 3.5 Analyzing Risk Cascades

Finally, the `analyze_risk_cascades` function simulates how the realization of our risk might trigger a cascade of other risks. For instance:

```python
cascade_progression = {
    1: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, ...],  # our risk starts at full impact
    5: [0.0, 0.6, 0.8, ...],  # supply chain risk increases over time
    ...
}
```

This analysis shows how our risk of increased extreme weather events could potentially trigger a cascade of other risks over time.

At the end of this step, we have a comprehensive understanding of how our risk interacts with and influences other risks in the system, providing crucial insights for scenario analysis and mitigation planning.
