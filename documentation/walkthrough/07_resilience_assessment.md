# Step 7: Resilience Assessment

In this step, we evaluate the resilience of the system to our risk ("Increased frequency of extreme weather events") and identify potential trigger points for cascading failures.

## 7.1 Evaluating System Resilience

The `assess_system_resilience` function in `src/risk_analysis/systemic_risk_analysis.py` calculates various resilience metrics:

```python
resilience_metrics = {
    "network_density": 0.6,
    "average_clustering": 0.7,
    "assortativity": 0.3,
    "Net Zero 2050_impact_dispersion": 0.2,
    "Delayed Transition_impact_dispersion": 0.4,
    "adaptive_capacity": 0.5
}
```

These metrics suggest that while the risk network is fairly dense and clustered, there's room for improvement in adaptive capacity, especially in more severe scenarios.

## 7.2 Identifying Trigger Points

The `identify_trigger_points` function assesses whether our risk could trigger cascading failures:

```python
trigger_points = {
    1: {
        "description": "Increased frequency of extreme weather events",
        "centrality": 0.8,
        "connected_risks": [2, 5, 7],
        "total_interaction_weight": 2.4,
        "external_factors": [
            "Temperature increase: 2.0Â°C",
            "Sea level rise: 0.5m"
        ]
    }
}
```

This analysis indicates that our risk is highly central in the risk network and strongly connected to other risks. It could potentially trigger cascading failures, especially if certain external factors (like temperature increase or sea level rise) reach critical levels.

The resilience assessment provides crucial information about the system's ability to withstand and recover from the impacts of increased extreme weather events, and highlights potential vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.
